# Inflexion Games Contribution Guidelines and Policy

Welcome! This project was created by the team at [Inflexion Games](https://https://www.inflexion.io/). We're glad you're interested in contributing! 

In order to keep the AffinityTable stable and unencumbered, the project does not normally accept new features. However, bug fixes are always welcome. 

## Contribution Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new feature branch.

3. Make your changes. Ensure that there are no build errors by running the project with your changes locally.

4. Open a pull request with a name and description of what you did. You can read more about working with pull requests on GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

5. A maintainer will review your pull request and either accept it or reject it. If accepted, they may ask you to make changes (or we might make those changes ourselves. Please don't be offended if we partially or completely rewrite your code)
